\begin{enumerate}
    
        \item{
         Utilized Daikon software and Symbolic Execution techniques to generate candidate invariants and implemented selfdesigned algorithms to produced better invariants set.}  
     
         \item{Configured and deployed Java/Symbolic PathFinder on Unix environment with Gradle and Eclipse; Employed Homebrew to setup prerequisites such as Graphviz, Texinfo, GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) to support invariants discovery.}
